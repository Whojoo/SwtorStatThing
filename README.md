# SwtorStatThing  
This is a little project I work on in my free time.  
The goal is to calculate the optimal stat distribution for any dicipline (or atleast a simplified version of it).

I use xml files for all the abilities.  
I use a json file for all the gear level values.  
The idea is to 'print' the results in a json file.
